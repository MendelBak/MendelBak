### Hi there!
I try to combine my passion and skills in software development and business, together with my vision of making the world a better place.

My personal Github is not as busy as I'd like it to be as I'm usually committing code to repos for companies for whom I work.

When not working or coding, I spend time on a variety of interests including improving my Hebrew, keeping up on exciting technologies (space exploration, electric propulsion, solar energy, VR/AR, etc.), video games, hiking, learning Torah, and more.
